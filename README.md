- 👋 Hi, I’m @gilles-38
- 👀 I’m interested in data manipulations, BI, datascience, AI/ML, predictive and prescriptive analytics... wanting to get into blockchain in the near future
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some Python ML techniques : linear/logistic regressions, association rules, time series, decision trees and ensemble modeling, neural networks, clustering, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on R tips. My level of proficiency with R (+ Rmarkdown + Shiny) is decent although I did not get into purrr nor into AIML yet.
- 📫 How to reach me : @gilles-38 or at gillesperry@free.fr
